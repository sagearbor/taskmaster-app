## üìä SESSION STATISTICS

### **Code Written:**
- **New files:** 8
- **Modified files:** 3
- **Total lines added:** ~1,400
- **Tests written:** 6 (all passing ‚úÖ)

### **Features Implemented:**

- ‚úÖ Privacy feature (can't see videos until you submit)
- ‚úÖ Task execution BLoC (state management)
- ‚úÖ Game settings (deadlines, auto-advance, etc.)

### **Compilation Status:**

---

## üéØ NEXT PRIORITIES

### **Immediate (Complete Day 5-7):**
1. **TaskExecutionScreen** - Main UI for task execution
   - Display task title, description
   - Timer widget (if task has duration)
   - Submission progress (X/Y players done)
   - Video URL input field
   - Submit button
   - Skip button (if allowed)

2. **TaskTimerWidget** - Countdown timer
   - Circular progress indicator
   - Shows remaining time
   - Color changes (green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí red)
   - Haptic feedback at milestones

3. **SubmissionProgressWidget** - Player progress tracker
   - List of players with status icons
   - ‚úÖ submitted, ‚è≥ in progress, ‚¨ú not started
   - Highlight current user

4. **VideoViewingScreen** - Privacy-controlled video list
   - Only show if user has submitted
   - List of all players' video links
   - Click to open in browser

### **After That (Day 8-9):**
- Implement "Start Game" functionality
- Update GameDetailBloc
- Navigate to TaskExecutionScreen when game starts

---

## üí° KEY DESIGN DECISIONS

### **1. Async-First Architecture**
- Games don't require all players online simultaneously
- Players submit when ready (up to deadline)
- Judge scores asynchronously
- Much more practical for real-world use

### **2. Privacy Feature**
- **Critical:** Players can't see others' videos until they submit
- Prevents copying/cheating
- Creates urgency ("I want to see what others did!")
- Implemented via `canPlayerViewVideos()` method

### **3. Smart Defaults**
- "Random 5" button lets users start game in <30 seconds
- No need to browse all 225 tasks
- Reduces friction significantly

### **4. Real-Time Updates**
- Using BLoC's `emit.forEach()` with game streams
- All players see updates instantly when someone submits
- Judge notified when all players are done

---

## üêõ ISSUES & NOTES

### **Known Issues:**
- None! All code compiles and tests pass.

### **TODO LATER:**
- Add more unit tests for Task and Game models
- Add integration tests for full game flow
- Consider pagination for task browser (performance with 225 tasks)
- Add analytics tracking

### **Technical Debt:**
- Remove debug print statements (many throughout)
- Add proper error handling for network failures
- Add offline mode support
