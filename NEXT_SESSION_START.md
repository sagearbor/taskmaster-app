# How to Start Next Session

## Quick Start Prompt

Copy and paste this to Claude in your next session:

```
I'm continuing work on the Taskmaster Flutter app.

Current status:
- Branch: feature/day26-30-testing-and-quick-play
- Firebase Auth is working (real Firebase, not mocks)
- Games create successfully
- Quick Play feature implemented

Issues to fix:
1. Tasks not showing in GameDetailScreen when clicking a game
2. Restrict game creation to registered users only (guests should only join)
3. Games not appearing in user's game list after creation

Please read:
- FIXES_APPLIED.md (what was done last session)
- HANDOFF_STATUS.md (overall project status)
- development_checklist.md (roadmap)

Start by diagnosing why tasks don't show in GameDetailScreen.
```

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- Firebase Authentication (anonymous, email/password)
- Real Firebase UIDs (no more mock_user_*)

- Permissions no longer blocked

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

**Priority 1: Tasks Not Showing**
- User creates game, clicks on it
- GameDetailScreen shows title but no tasks
- Need to debug GameDetailView rendering

**Priority 2: Game List Filter**
- Games created but don't appear in creator's list
- Filtering logic in `firestore_game_data_source.dart` needs review
- Extensive logging added - check browser console

**Priority 3: Auth Restrictions**
- Guests can currently create games (should only join)
- Need to implement: Check `isAnonymous` ‚Üí redirect to signup
- See HANDOFF_STATUS.md Priority 2

### üìÇ Key Files to Check

**Game Detail Issue:**
- `lib/features/games/presentation/screens/game_detail_screen.dart`
- `lib/features/games/presentation/bloc/game_detail_bloc.dart`
- Check if tasks are in the Game object from Firestore

**Game List Issue:**
- `lib/features/games/data/datasources/firestore_game_data_source.dart:29-58`
- Debug logs show filtering logic
- Check browser console for: "Total games in Firestore", "Filtered to X games"

**Auth Restrictions:**
- `lib/features/games/presentation/screens/create_game_screen.dart`
- `lib/features/home/presentation/screens/home_screen.dart` (Quick Play)
- Need to add `if (isAnonymous) showSignupDialog()`

### üîç Debugging Steps

1. **Open browser DevTools Console**
2. **Look for debug logs:**
   - `[CreateGameScreen] Game created successfully with ID: ...`
   - `Total games in Firestore: X`
   - `Filtered to Y games for user ABC`
   - `Game XYZ: isCreator=..., isPlayer=..., shouldShow=...`

3. **Check Firestore Console:**
   - https://console.firebase.google.com/project/taskmaster-app-3d480/firestore
   - Look at `games` collection
   - Verify `tasks` array has data
   - Verify `players` array has creator
