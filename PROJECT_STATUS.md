## ðŸ¤– Note for AI Coding

**"Multi-device testing" = Multiple browser windows**, not physical devices!

When instructions say "device A" and "device B", this means:
- Open the app in 2+ browser windows (Chrome + Firefox, or Chrome + incognito)
- Each browser window represents a different user/device
- Test that changes in one browser window appear instantly in the other

**Example:**
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
# Then open http://localhost:PORT in Firefox or Chrome incognito
# Now you have "2 devices" for testing
```

---

## ðŸŽ‰ What's Complete

**Phase 1 (Days 1-21):** âœ… Complete
- Full UI implementation
- Mock data with realistic scenarios
- 30+ unit tests, 11 integration tests

**Phase 2 (Days 22-25):** âœ… Complete
- Firebase Firestore integration
- Real-time multiplayer
- 21 unit tests with fake_cloud_firestore
- Security rules and indexes deployed

**Current State:**
- All code merged to `main`
- PR #8 closed
- Ready for next phase

---

## ðŸ“‹ Day 26-27: Firebase Integration Testing

### Goal
Test real-time multiplayer with actual Firebase on multiple devices

### What to Implement

#### 1. Switch to Firebase (if not already) âœ…
**File:** `lib/main.dart`

~~Check that `main.dart` uses Firebase:~~
```dart
await ServiceLocator.init(useMockServices: false); // âœ… CONFIRMED
```

~~If not, change from `true` to `false`.~~ **DONE - Firebase is enabled**

#### 2. Multi-Device Testing Setup

**IMPORTANT FOR AI CODING:**
You don't need physical devices! Testing with multiple browser windows is the easiest approach:

**Recommended Setup (easiest):**
```bash
# Option 1: Chrome + Firefox (both open at same time)
flutter run -d chrome          # Terminal 1
flutter run -d edge            # Terminal 2 (or manually open in Firefox)

# Option 2: Chrome normal + Chrome incognito
# Run app, then open http://localhost:PORT in incognito window

# Option 3: Multiple Chrome windows (sign in as different users)
# Open app in multiple Chrome windows with different guest profiles
```

**What "device A" and "device B" mean:**
- "Device A" = Browser window #1
- "Device B" = Browser window #2 (different browser or incognito)
- "Device C" = Browser window #3 (if testing 3+ players)

**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] **Test 1:** Create game on device A â†’ Join via invite code on device B
- [ ] **Test 2:** Submit task on device A â†’ See submission count update instantly on device B
- [ ] **Test 3:** Judge scores on device B â†’ See scores and scoreboard on device A
- [ ] **Test 4:** 3+ devices simultaneously playing same game
- [ ] **Test 5:** Video privacy - ensure players can't see others' videos until they submit

#### 3. Real-Time Update Verification
Verify these happen instantly across all devices:
- [ ] Player joins game â†’ All players see new player in list
- [ ] Player submits task â†’ Submission count updates for everyone
- [ ] All players submit â†’ Judge sees "Ready to Judge" status
- [ ] Judge scores â†’ Scores appear on all players' devices
- [ ] Next task unlocked â†’ All players see new task

#### 4. Offline/Network Testing
- [ ] Disconnect WiFi mid-game
- [ ] Try to submit task (should queue or show error)
- [ ] Reconnect WiFi
- [ ] Verify submission syncs automatically
- [ ] Check Firestore offline persistence

#### 5. Bug Fixes
Document any issues found:
- Real-time sync delays
- Race conditions (e.g., two players submitting simultaneously)
- UI not updating
- Network errors

**Create GitHub issues for any bugs found!**

## ðŸ“‹ Day 28: Cloud Functions Setup

### Goal
Set up Firebase Cloud Functions for automated notifications

### What to Implement

#### 1. Initialize Firebase Functions
```bash
# In project root
firebase init functions

# Select:
# - TypeScript (recommended)
# - Install dependencies: Yes
```

#### 2. Create Cloud Functions
**File:** `functions/src/index.ts`

Implement these functions:

**Function 1: onGameStarted**
```typescript
export const onGameStarted = functions.firestore
  .document('games/{gameId}')
  .onUpdate(async (change, context) => {
    const before = change.before.data();
    const after = change.after.data();

    // If status changed from 'lobby' to 'inProgress'
    if (before.status === 'lobby' && after.status === 'inProgress') {
      // Send notification to all players
      // "Game started! First task unlocked."
    }
  });
```

**Function 2: onAllSubmitted**
```typescript
export const onAllSubmitted = functions.firestore
  .document('games/{gameId}')
  .onUpdate(async (change, context) => {
    const game = change.after.data();
    const currentTask = game.tasks[game.currentTaskIndex];

    // If task status changed to 'ready_to_judge'
    if (currentTask.status === 'ready_to_judge') {
      // Send notification to judge
      // "All players submitted! Ready to judge."
    }
  });
```

**Function 3: onTaskScored**
```typescript
export const onTaskScored = functions.firestore
  .document('games/{gameId}')
  .onUpdate(async (change, context) => {
    const game = change.after.data();
    const currentTask = game.tasks[game.currentTaskIndex];

    // If task status changed to 'completed'
    if (currentTask.status === 'completed') {
      // Send notification to all players
      // "Scores posted! Check the leaderboard."
    }
  });
```

**Function 4: onDeadlinePassed** (Optional)
```typescript
export const checkDeadlines = functions.pubsub
  .schedule('every 1 hours')
  .onRun(async (context) => {
    // Query games with expired deadlines
    // Auto-transition to judging phase
  });
```

#### 3. Deploy Functions
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

#### 4. Test Functions
- Check Firebase Console â†’ Functions â†’ Logs
- Trigger each function by performing actions in app
- Verify notifications appear (if FCM set up)

**Note:** Cloud Functions add cost but are critical for async notifications. Monitor usage in Firebase Console.

## ðŸ“‹ Day 29-30: Quick Play Button âœ…

### Goal
Add "Quick Play" button for instant game creation

**STATUS: âœ… COMPLETED**

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Add Quick Play Button to Home Screen âœ…
**File:** `lib/features/home/presentation/screens/home_screen.dart`

~~Add prominent FloatingActionButton:~~ **DONE - Added hero banner with Quick Play**
```dart
floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton.extended(
  onPressed: () => context.read<GamesBloc>().add(QuickPlayGame()),
  icon: Icon(Icons.flash_on),
  label: Text('âš¡ Quick Play'),
  backgroundColor: Colors.orange,
),
```

Or hero banner at top:
```dart
Card(
  child: InkWell(
    onTap: () => context.read<GamesBloc>().add(QuickPlayGame()),
    child: Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(24),
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        gradient: LinearGradient(
          colors: [Colors.orange, Colors.deepOrange],
        ),
      ),
      child: Row(
        children: [
          Icon(Icons.flash_on, size: 48, color: Colors.white),
          SizedBox(width: 16),
          Column(
            crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
            children: [
              Text('âš¡ Quick Play', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
              Text('Jump into a game in seconds!'),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ),
  ),
)
```

#### 2. Add QuickPlayGame Event âœ…
**File:** `lib/features/games/presentation/bloc/games_bloc.dart`

**DONE - Implemented with:**

```dart
// Add to events
class QuickPlayGame extends GamesEvent {}

// Add to bloc
Future<void> _onQuickPlayGame(
  QuickPlayGame event,
  Emitter<GamesState> emit,
) async {
  emit(GamesLoading());

  try {
    // Get current user
    final userId = await _authRepository.getCurrentUserId();
    if (userId == null) throw Exception('Not authenticated');

    // Generate fun game name
    final gameName = _generateGameName();

    // Select 5 random tasks from different categories
    final randomTasks = await _taskRepository.getRandomTasks(count: 5);

    // Create game
    final game = Game(
      id: '', // Firestore will generate
      gameName: gameName,
      creatorId: userId,
      judgeId: userId, // Creator is judge in Quick Play
      status: GameStatus.inProgress, // Skip lobby!
      inviteCode: _generateInviteCode(),
      players: [
        Player(userId: userId, displayName: 'You', totalScore: 0),
      ],
      tasks: randomTasks,
      currentTaskIndex: 0,
      createdAt: DateTime.now(),
      settings: GameSettings(
        mode: GameMode.async,
        taskDeadlineHours: 24,
        autoAdvanceEnabled: true,
      ),
    );

    // Create in Firestore
    final gameId = await _gameRepository.createGame(game);

    // Start game immediately
    await _gameRepository.startGame(gameId);

    emit(QuickPlaySuccess(gameId));
  } catch (e) {
    emit(GamesError(e.toString()));
  }
}

String _generateGameName() {
  final adjectives = ['Epic', 'Awesome', 'Crazy', 'Wild', 'Fun'];
  final nouns = ['Adventure', 'Challenge', 'Quest', 'Game', 'Mission'];
  final adj = adjectives[Random().nextInt(adjectives.length)];
  final noun = nouns[Random().nextInt(nouns.length)];
  return '$adj $noun #${Random().nextInt(9999)}';
}
```

#### 3. Navigate to Task Execution âœ…
**File:** `lib/features/home/presentation/screens/home_screen.dart`

**DONE - Added BlocListener:**
```dart
BlocListener<GamesBloc, GamesState>(
  listener: (context, state) {
    if (state is QuickPlaySuccess) {
      // Navigate directly to first task
      Navigator.pushNamed(
        context,
        '/task-execution',
        arguments: {'gameId': state.gameId, 'taskIndex': 0},
      );
    }
  },
  child: // ... existing widget
)
```

#### 4. Optimize Performance
**Pre-cache random tasks on app start:**
```dart
// In main.dart or GamesBloc constructor
await _taskRepository.precacheRandomTasks();
```

This ensures Quick Play is instant (<1 second)!

#### 5. Add Tests âœ…
**File:** `test/features/games/presentation/bloc/games_bloc_test.dart`

**DONE - Added 5 comprehensive tests:**
- âœ… emits [GamesLoading, QuickPlaySuccess] when quick play succeeds
- âœ… creates game with correct properties (user as creator and judge)
- âœ… emits GamesError when user is not authenticated
- âœ… emits GamesError when game creation fails
- âœ… emits GamesError when game update fails

**All tests passing!**

```dart
test('QuickPlayGame creates and starts game', () async {
  when(() => mockTaskRepository.getRandomTasks(count: 5))
    .thenAnswer((_) async => mockTasks);
  when(() => mockGameRepository.createGame(any()))
    .thenAnswer((_) async => 'game_123');
  when(() => mockGameRepository.startGame('game_123'))
    .thenAnswer((_) async => {});

  bloc.add(QuickPlayGame());

  await expectLater(
    bloc.stream,
    emitsInOrder([
      GamesLoading(),
      QuickPlaySuccess('game_123'),
    ]),
  );
});
```
