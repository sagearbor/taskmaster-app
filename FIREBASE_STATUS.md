- ✅ Google authentication enabled
- ✅ Anonymous authentication enabled
- ✅ Firestore database created (us-east4)
- ✅ Security rules published

### 4. App Code - Updated ✅

## ⚠️ Current Blocker: Network/Proxy Issue

Your corporate network (likely Zscaler/proxy) is blocking:
- `fonts.gstatic.com` (Google Fonts)
- `www.gstatic.com/flutter-canvaskit` (Flutter web renderer)

This prevents Flutter web apps from running locally in Chrome.

---

## 🎯 Next Steps - Choose One:

### Option A: Test on Different Network (Recommended)
**Best for immediate testing**

1. Connect to a non-corporate network (home WiFi, mobile hotspot)
2. Run: `flutter run -d chrome -t lib/main_firebase_test.dart`
3. Test Firebase authentication:
   - Click "Test Sign Up" button
   - Check Firebase Console → Authentication → Users
   - If you see the user, **Firebase is working!**

### Option B: Deploy to Firebase Hosting
**Test without running locally**

```bash
# Build the web app
flutter build web

# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

Then visit: `https://taskmaster-app-3d480.web.app`

This bypasses your local network restrictions entirely!

### Option C: Configure Proxy Bypass (Advanced)
**If you have IT permissions**

Add to your system/browser proxy settings:
```
NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,fonts.gstatic.com,gstatic.com
```

## 🧪 How to Test Firebase is Working

### Test File Created: `lib/main_firebase_test.dart`

This is a simple test app that:
1. Connects to Firebase
2. Shows connection status
3. Lets you test Sign Up / Sign In
4. No complex dependencies (works around network issues)

**Run it with:**
```bash
flutter run -d chrome -t lib/main_firebase_test.dart
```

### What Success Looks Like:

1. **Firebase Connected**: You'll see "✅ Firebase Connected!"
2. **Create Test User**: Click "Test Sign Up"
3. **Verify in Firebase Console**:
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/taskmaster-app-3d480/authentication/users
   - You should see: `test@example.com` in the users list
4. **Sign In Works**: Click "Test Sign In" - should succeed

## 📋 What This Means for Your App

### Firebase is Configured Correctly ✅
All setup steps are done:
- Firebase project created
- Web app registered
- Authentication enabled
- Firestore database ready
- Security rules in place
- App code updated to use Firebase

### Data Will Persist 🎉
Once you can run the app:
- User accounts will be real (not mocked)
- Games will save to Firestore
- Data persists across sessions
- Multiple users can play together
- Real-time updates will work

### Mock Services Still Work 📱
You can still develop offline using:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome -t lib/main_simple.dart
```

This uses mocks and doesn't need Firebase connection.

## 🚀 Production Deployment Checklist

Once Firebase testing works, you can:

1. **Deploy to Web**:
   ```bash
   flutter build web
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```
   Live at: `https://taskmaster-app-3d480.web.app`

2. **Update Security Rules** (before public launch):
   - Switch Firestore from "test mode" to production rules
   - Add rate limiting
   - Add data validation

3. **Enable Analytics** (optional):
   - Firebase Analytics
   - Performance Monitoring
   - Crashlytics

4. **Set Up Custom Domain** (optional):
   - Firebase Hosting supports custom domains
   - Can use `taskmasterapp.com` or similar

---

## 📞 Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Test Firebase connection
flutter run -d chrome -t lib/main_firebase_test.dart

# Run with mocks (offline)
flutter run -d chrome -t lib/main_simple.dart

# Run full app with Firebase
flutter run -d chrome

# Deploy to web
flutter build web && firebase deploy --only hosting

# Check Firebase projects
firebase projects:list

# View Firebase logs
firebase login:list
```

---

## ✨ Summary

**You're 95% done!**

The only remaining step is testing the Firebase connection, which is blocked by your network. Once you:
1. Get on a different network, OR
2. Deploy to Firebase Hosting

...you'll be able to verify that authentication and database are working, and then your full app will be functional with real data persistence!
