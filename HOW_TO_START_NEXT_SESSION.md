## üìñ How to Use DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md

### Structure:
- **Phases 1-3:** Day-by-day implementation guide (Days 1-35)
  - Very detailed with specific files and code snippets
  - Use these for step-by-step implementation

- **Phases 4-10:** Feature-based roadmap
  - High-level feature descriptions
  - Use these for planning and prioritization
  - Phase 10 (3D Avatars) has detailed sub-phases

### Example Session Prompts:

**To continue Phase 3:**
```
I want to finish Phase 3 (Reduce Friction) in DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md.
Day 29-30 (Quick Play) is done. Let's implement Day 31: In-Game Invite Flow.
Please read lines 649-705 of DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md and help me implement it.
```

**To start Phase 4 (Mobile):**
```
I want to deploy the Taskmaster app to mobile stores (Phase 4).
Please help me:
1. Configure Flutter for iOS and Android builds
2. Set up app store listings
3. Generate release builds
4. Submit to Google Play and App Store
```

**To start Phase 6 (Advanced Features):**
```
The MVP is done. I want to add advanced features from Phase 6.
Please read Phase 6 in DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md (lines 930-965) and help me pick

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always reference line numbers** when asking AI to implement something:
   - "Implement Day 31 from DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md lines 649-705"

2. **Start with small tasks** to build momentum:
   - Don't jump to Phase 10 immediately
   - Finish Phase 3, then move to Phase 4

3. **Test after each feature:**
   - Use `MULTI_DEVICE_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
   - Open app in 2 browser windows to verify sync

4. **Keep DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md updated:**
   - Mark items [x] as you complete them
   - Add notes about what worked/didn't work
