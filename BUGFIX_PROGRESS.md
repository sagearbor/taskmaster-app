# Bug Fix Progress - Session 2025-09-30

**Branch:** `bugfix/game-detail-and-auth-restrictions`

## Status: 1/3 Bugs Fixed

### ✅ Bug #1: Tasks Not Showing - FIXED
**File:** `lib/features/games/presentation/widgets/game_lobby_view.dart`

**Problem:** GameLobbyView showed "5 tasks" but didn't display the actual task list.

**Fix:** Added Tasks section card showing:
- Numbered list (1, 2, 3...)
- Task title
- Task description (truncated if long)

**Commit:** `4ef0549 - fix: Add tasks list to GameLobbyView`

### ⏳ Bug #2: Games Not Appearing - TODO
**Files to check:**
- `lib/features/games/data/datasources/firestore_game_data_source.dart` (lines 29-58)
- Creator filter logic already added (shows if creatorId OR in players)
- Extensive logging added

**Debug approach:**
1. Check browser console logs
2. Look for: "Filtered to X games for user ABC"
3. Verify `isCreator=true` for user's games
4. May need to check if `players` array has creator

---

### ⏳ Bug #3: Restrict Game Creation - TODO
**Files to modify:**
1. `lib/features/home/presentation/screens/home_screen.dart`
   - Quick Play button: check `isAnonymous`
   - Show dialog: "Sign up to create games"

2. `lib/features/games/presentation/screens/create_game_screen.dart`
   - Add check in initState or build
   - Redirect anonymous users to signup

**Implementation:**
```dart
// Add to AuthRepository
Future<bool> isCurrentUserAnonymous() async {
  final user = FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser;
  return user?.isAnonymous ?? true;
}

// In HomeScreen Quick Play
if (await authRepo.isCurrentUserAnonymous()) {
  showDialog("Sign up to create multiplayer games");
} else {
  // Proceed with Quick Play
}
```
