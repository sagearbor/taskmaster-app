**Date:** 2025-09-30
**Branch:** `feature/day26-30-testing-and-quick-play`
**Deployed URL:** https://taskmaster-app-3d480.web.app

## ✅ Completed This Session

### 1. Quick Play Feature (Day 29-30) - COMPLETE
**Status:** ✅ Fully implemented, tested, and deployed

**What was built:**
- Hero banner UI with ⚡ Quick Play button on home screen
- Random game name generator (e.g., "Epic Adventure #4273")
- Automatic selection of 5 random tasks from 225+ prebuilt tasks
- Creates game with user as both creator and judge
- Sets game to `inProgress` status (bypasses lobby)
- Navigates directly to game detail screen

**Files modified:**
- `lib/features/games/presentation/bloc/games_bloc.dart` - Quick Play logic
- `lib/features/games/presentation/bloc/games_event.dart` - QuickPlayGame event
- `lib/features/games/presentation/bloc/games_state.dart` - QuickPlaySuccess state
- `lib/features/home/presentation/screens/home_screen.dart` - Quick Play UI
- `test/features/games/presentation/bloc/games_bloc_test.dart` - 5 new tests

**Tests:** 5/5 Quick Play tests passing ✅

**Commits:**
- `b176b1e` - feat: Implement Quick Play feature for instant game creation
- `a941fe7` - docs: Add comprehensive 3D avatar system specification

### 2. 3D Avatar Specification - COMPLETE
**Status:** ✅ Detailed specification added to `development_checklist.md`

**Location:** Phase 10 in `development_checklist.md` (lines 216-521)

**Technology Decision:**
- **2.5D Isometric** (NOT full 3D)
- Flame game engine + forge2d physics
- Better web performance than true 3D
- Graceful fallback for low-end devices

**Implementation broken into 5 phases:**
1. Foundation (Days 1-2) - Setup Flame overlay
2. Avatar Bodies (Days 3-5) - Create animated characters
3. UI Integration (Days 6-8) - Climbing on game cards
4. Physics Interactions (Days 9-10) - Push mechanics, behaviors
5. Performance & Polish (Days 11-12) - Optimization, sounds

**Estimated timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Priority:** Medium-Low (V3-V4 feature, after core game is stable)

### 3. Deployment & Security - COMPLETE
**Status:** ✅ Latest code deployed with security rules

**Deployed:**
- Flutter web app to Firebase Hosting
- Firestore security rules
- Firestore indexes

**URL:** https://taskmaster-app-3d480.web.app

**Security rules allow:**
- ✅ Any authenticated user (including guests) can READ games
- ✅ Any authenticated user can CREATE games (creatorId must match UID)
- ✅ Creator, judge, or players can UPDATE games
- ✅ Only creator can DELETE games

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Issue #1: Permissions Error on Deployed Site
**Status:** Should be fixed now (rules just deployed)

**Error:** "missing or insufficient permissions" when creating/saving games

**Cause:** Firestore security rules were not deployed with latest code

**Fix Applied:**
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

**Next Step:** Try creating a game again at https://taskmaster-app-3d480.web.app

### Issue #2: Auth Implementation Still Uses Mocks
**Status:** Needs implementation

**Current state:**
- `FirebaseAuthDataSource` extends `MockAuthDataSource`
- Real Firebase Auth is initialized but not fully wired up
- App works locally but may have issues in production

**What needs doing:**
- Implement real Firebase Auth in `FirebaseAuthDataSource`
- Remove mock inheritance
- Test with real Firebase

---

## 📋 Next Steps (Phase 2: Auth Improvements)

### Priority 1: Fix Auth to Use Real Firebase
**Current:** Auth is mocked
**Needed:** Real Firebase Authentication

**Files to update:**
1. `lib/features/auth/data/datasources/firebase_auth_data_source.dart`
   - Remove mock inheritance
   - Implement real FirebaseAuth calls

2. `lib/features/auth/data/repositories/auth_repository_impl.dart`
   - Fetch real user data from Firestore
   - Handle anonymous vs. email/password distinction

### Priority 2: Restrict Game Creation to Registered Users
**Goal:** Guests can join games, but only registered users can create

**Implementation steps:**
1. Add `isAnonymous` check to AuthRepository:
```dart
Future<bool> isCurrentUserAnonymous() async {
  final user = FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser;
  return user?.isAnonymous ?? true;
}
```

2. Update CreateGameScreen:
```dart
if (await authRepository.isCurrentUserAnonymous()) {
  // Show "Sign up to host multiplayer games" message
  showDialog(...);
} else {
  // Allow game creation
  Navigator.push(CreateGameScreen());
}
```

3. Update Quick Play:
```dart
// In Quick Play handler
if (await authRepository.isCurrentUserAnonymous()) {
  // Create solo game (no sharing)
} else {
  // Create multiplayer game with invite code
}
```

### Priority 3: Add Profile Photos
**Goal:** Users can upload/capture profile photos

**Implementation steps:**
1. Add `photoUrl` field to User model
2. Add Firebase Storage setup
3. Create photo upload UI
4. Implement camera capture (mobile)
5. Generate fallback avatars

### Priority 4: Online Friends List
**Goal:** Show vertical list of online friends with profile pics

**Implementation steps:**
1. Add presence tracking to Firestore
2. Create friends list widget
3. Show online status indicator
4. Navigate to shared game on click

## 🎯 Testing Instructions

### Test Quick Play (Locally)
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

1. Sign in as guest or with email
2. Click "⚡ Quick Play" banner
3. Should create game and navigate to detail screen
4. Game should have 5 random tasks

### Test on Deployed Site
Go to: https://taskmaster-app-3d480.web.app

1. Sign in (guest or email)
2. Try creating a game
3. **Expected:** Should work now (permissions fixed)
4. **If still errors:** Check browser console for details

### Multi-Device Testing (Manual)
1. Open app in Chrome: http://localhost:8080
2. Open in Firefox or Chrome incognito
3. User A: Create game, note invite code
4. User B: Join with invite code
5. Verify real-time sync works
