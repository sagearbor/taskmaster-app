# Taskmaster App - Current Status

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. Firebase Setup - **COMPLETE!** 🎉
- ✅ Firebase project: `taskmaster-app-3d480`
- ✅ FlutterFire CLI configured
- ✅ `firebase_options.dart` generated
- ✅ **Authentication TESTED and WORKING**
  - Email/Password enabled
  - Google Sign-In enabled
  - Anonymous enabled
  - Successfully created test user in Firebase Console

### 2. App Architecture - **BUILT!**
- ✅ 200+ prebuilt tasks (17 secret tasks, 18 modifiers, 12 location types)
- ✅ Clean architecture with BLoC pattern
- ✅ Mock services working for offline development
- ✅ All screens implemented:
  - Authentication (Login/Register)
  - Home screen (game list)
  - Create Game
  - Game Lobby
  - Task View
  - Judging Screen
  - Scoreboard
  - Community features
  - Store UI (ads/IAP mocked)

## ⚠️ Current Issue: Main App Loading Problem

**Problem:** When running `flutter run -d chrome` (main.dart), the app shows:
- Infinite loading spinner
- OR blank white screen
- No visible UI

**Root Cause:** The `lib/main.dart` has complex initialization (ErrorBoundary, PerformanceOverlay, CacheManager, etc.) that causes issues on startup.

---

## 🎯 What Works RIGHT NOW

### Run the Simple Version:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome -t lib/main_simple.dart
```

This bypasses the complex initialization and gives you:
- Login/Register screen
- Full app functionality
- Mock data (games, tasks, users)
- All 200+ tasks available

**Important:** You need Zscaler OFF to run Flutter web apps locally (blocks Google Fonts and CanvasKit).

---

## 🔧 What Needs To Be Done

### Priority 1: Fix Main Entry Point
The main.dart needs simplification:
1. Remove ErrorBoundary wrapper (causing Directionality errors)
2. Remove PerformanceOverlay wrapper
3. Simplify initialization
4. Make it identical to main_simple.dart but cleaner

### Priority 2: Implement Firebase Data Sources
Currently Firebase data sources are stubs that just extend mocks:
- `lib/features/games/data/datasources/firebase_game_data_source.dart` - Stub
- `lib/features/tasks/data/datasources/firebase_task_data_source.dart` - Stub

These need real Firestore implementations:
- CRUD operations for games
- Real-time listeners for game updates
- Task management
- Player/submission tracking

**Firebase Auth already works!** The auth data source is functional.

### Priority 3: Deploy to Firebase Hosting
Once the app loads correctly:
```bash
flutter build web
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

This will make it accessible at: `https://taskmaster-app-3d480.web.app`

## 📋 Quick Commands

### Development (Offline with Mocks)
```bash
# Working version with all features
flutter run -d chrome -t lib/main_simple.dart

# Minimal test (no dependencies)
flutter run -d chrome -t lib/main_test.dart

# Firebase connection test
flutter run -d chrome -t lib/main_firebase_test.dart
```

### Testing Firebase
1. Turn off Zscaler temporarily
2. Run: `flutter run -d chrome -t lib/main_firebase_test.dart`
3. Test Sign Up / Sign In
4. Check Firebase Console for users

### Production Deployment
```bash
flutter build web
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## 📁 Important Files

### Entry Points
- `lib/main.dart` - ❌ Currently broken (complex initialization)
- `lib/main_simple.dart` - ✅ **WORKING** (use this!)
- `lib/main_firebase_test.dart` - ✅ Firebase connection test
- `lib/main_test.dart` - ✅ Minimal Flutter test

### Configuration
- `lib/firebase_options.dart` - ✅ Generated by FlutterFire CLI
- `lib/core/di/service_locator.dart` - Dependency injection setup
- `lib/core/config/environment.dart` - Environment configuration

### Data Sources (Need Implementation)
- `lib/features/games/data/datasources/firebase_game_data_source.dart` - TODO
- `lib/features/tasks/data/datasources/firebase_task_data_source.dart` - TODO
- `lib/features/auth/data/datasources/firebase_auth_data_source.dart` - ✅ Working!

## 🚀 Next Session Checklist

1. **Fix main.dart to load properly**
   - Remove ErrorBoundary/PerformanceOverlay wrappers
   - Test it loads without infinite spinner
   - Make it as simple as main_simple.dart

2. **Implement Firebase Game Data Source**
   - Replace stub with real Firestore operations
   - Add CRUD for games collection
   - Add real-time listeners

3. **Implement Firebase Task Data Source**
   - Firestore operations for tasks
   - Community tasks integration

4. **Test full flow with Firebase**
   - Create game → saves to Firestore
   - Join game → real-time updates
   - Submit tasks → persists
   - Judging → updates scores

5. **Deploy to Firebase Hosting**
   - Build production web app
   - Deploy to hosting
   - Test at live URL

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Firebase Auth Works!** - Successfully tested user creation/sign-in
2. **Zscaler Blocks Flutter Web** - Need to disable for local testing
3. **Main.dart Too Complex** - Simpler entry points work fine
4. **Mock Services Work Great** - All features functional with mocks
5. **Firebase Data Sources Need Implementation** - Currently just stubs
