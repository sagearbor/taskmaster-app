### 🚀 What's Working Now

**Firebase Infrastructure:**

## 📋 What to Do Next

### Option 1: Multi-Device Testing (Recommended)
**Goal:** Test real-time multiplayer with actual Firebase

**Setup:**
1. Open the app in 2 different browsers (Chrome + Firefox)
2. Or use Chrome normal + incognito mode
3. Sign in as different users (guest auth is fine)

**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] Create game in Browser A
- [ ] Join game via invite code in Browser B
- [ ] Verify real-time player list updates
- [ ] Start game and submit tasks from both browsers
- [ ] Verify submission progress updates in real-time
- [ ] Judge scores and verify scoreboard updates
- [ ] Test task progression

**Expected Behavior:**
- Changes in one browser should appear instantly in the other
- Player list should update when someone joins
- Submission counts should update when players submit
- Scores should appear on scoreboard after judging

### Option 2: Switch Default to Firebase
**Goal:** Make Firebase the default data source

**Current State:**
- `main.dart` already uses Firebase (`useMockServices: false`)
- `lib/main_mock.dart` available for mock testing
- Service locator supports both modes

**No action needed** - Firebase is already the default in production!

### Option 3: Deploy and Test Live
**Goal:** Deploy to Firebase Hosting and test

**Commands:**
```bash
# Build for web
flutter build web --release

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting

# Visit deployed app
open https://taskmaster-app-3d480.web.app/
```

**Test on deployed site:**
- Create account
- Create game
- Invite friend (or use second device)
- Play through a full game

## 🐛 Known Issues to Watch For

### Potential Issues (Not Yet Tested)
1. **Race Conditions:**
   - Multiple players submitting simultaneously
   - Judge scoring while players still submitting
   - **Solution:** Consider Firestore transactions for critical updates

2. **Offline Mode:**
   - What happens if network drops during game?
   - Does Firestore offline persistence work?
   - **Test:** Disable network mid-game, then reconnect

3. **Large Player Counts:**
   - App tested with mock data (3-4 players)
   - Not tested with 10 players yet
   - **Test:** Create game with max players

4. **Video Privacy:**
   - Privacy currently enforced at application level
   - Not enforced by Firestore rules (intentionally simplified)
   - **Note:** This is acceptable for MVP

### Current Limitations
- Firestore security rules simplified (all authenticated users can read/write games)
- Client-side filtering for user games (not server-side query)
- No caching layer (every read hits Firestore)
- No batch writes (could improve performance)

## 📝 Testing Checklist

### Basic CRUD (Unit Tests Pass ✅)
- [x] Create game
- [x] Read games stream
- [x] Update game
- [x] Delete game
- [x] Join by invite code

### Game Flow (Need Manual Testing)
- [ ] Create game → Select tasks → View game detail
- [ ] Invite players → Multiple users join
- [ ] Start game → First task initialized
- [ ] Submit videos → Progress tracked
- [ ] All players submit → Task ready to judge
- [ ] Judge scores → Scores update
- [ ] View scoreboard → Animations work
- [ ] Advance to next task → Task progression works
- [ ] Complete all tasks → Game ends

### Real-Time Updates (Need Manual Testing)
- [ ] Player joins → All users see new player instantly
- [ ] Player submits → Submission count updates for all
- [ ] Judge scores → Scores appear for all players
- [ ] Task advances → New task loads for all

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Invalid invite code → Shows error
- [ ] Start game with 1 player → Shows error
- [ ] Start game with 0 tasks → Shows error
- [ ] Submit after deadline → (Should still work in MVP)
- [ ] Player leaves mid-game → (Game continues)

## 🚨 If Issues Arise

### Firestore Permission Errors
```
Error: Missing or insufficient permissions
```
**Check:**
1. User is authenticated (even as guest)
2. Firestore rules deployed: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
3. Browser console for auth state

### Index Not Found Errors
```
Error: The query requires an index
```
**Solution:**
1. Click the link in the error message
2. Or manually create index in Firebase console
3. Wait 1-5 minutes for index to build
4. Retry operation

### Data Not Syncing
**Check:**
1. Console logs for errors
2. Firebase console → Firestore → Verify data exists
3. Network tab → Check for 403 errors
4. Verify `main.dart` uses `useMockServices: false`

### Game Creation Fails
**Debug Steps:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify auth state: `FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser`
3. Check Firestore rules in Firebase console
4. Try creating game directly in Firebase console

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate (5 minutes):**
   - Run `flutter run -d chrome` to test locally
   - Create a game and verify it appears in Firebase console
   - Check browser console for any errors

2. **Short Term (30 minutes):**
   - Multi-device testing with 2 browsers
   - Test full game flow end-to-end
   - Document any bugs in GitHub issues

3. **Medium Term (1-2 hours):**
   - Deploy to Firebase Hosting
   - Test with real users (friends/family)
   - Performance testing with larger games

4. **Long Term (Next Phase):**
   - Implement remaining features (notifications, community tasks)
   - UI polish and error states
   - Mobile app builds (iOS/Android)
