### Previous Bug Fixes

#### Fixed Stream Issues
**Problem:** Infinite loading spinner when clicking games
**Solution:** Changed to async generator pattern (`async*` + `yield`)

#### Fixed BLoC Provider Issues
**Problem:** "Provider<AuthBloc> not found" errors on navigation
**Solution:** Moved AuthBloc provider to wrap MaterialApp globally in main.dart

#### Fixed Firestore Security Rules
**Problem:** Guest users couldn't read/write game data
**Solution:** Added security rules to allow authenticated users (including anonymous)

## Next Steps / TODO üìã

### High Priority (Days 15-21)
1. **UI States & Error Handling** (Days 15-17)
   - Replace spinners with skeleton screens (shimmer package)
   - Add error states with retry buttons
   - State-specific banners (waiting, judging, completed)
   - Handle edge cases (no submissions, judge skips all)
   - Proper back button handling

2. **Async Flow Testing** (Days 18-19)
   - End-to-end game flow testing
   - Multi-player testing (different browsers/devices)
   - Out-of-order submission testing
   - Partial judging testing
   - Privacy feature validation
   - Performance testing (10 players, 20 tasks)
   - Bug fixes from testing

3. **Mock Data Enhancements** (Days 20-21)
   - Update mock games with new field support
   - Realistic sample data in different states
   - Simulate async delays for realism
   - Support all state transitions
   - Mock notification service

### Medium Priority
4. **Invite Code System**
   - Complete join game flow
   - Share invite code functionality
   - Handle invite code errors gracefully

5. **User Profile**
   - Display user profile in app bar
   - Allow display name editing
   - Show user stats

6. **UI Polish**
   - Remove debug print statements
   - Improve loading states
   - Add error handling UI
   - Better empty states

### Low Priority
7. **Community Features**
   - Task suggestions
   - Upvoting system
   - Task library

## Development Commands

```bash
# Run locally (uses mock services)
flutter run -d chrome

# Build for web
flutter build web

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting

# Run tests
flutter test

# Clean rebuild
flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter run -d chrome
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Infinite loading spinner
**Solution:** The async generator fixes have resolved this. If it recurs, check:
1. Ensure streams use `async*` and `yield` pattern
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify mock data is being emitted

### Issue: "Provider not found" errors
**Solution:** Fixed by global AuthBloc. If it recurs:
1. Ensure BlocProvider wraps MaterialApp in main.dart
2. Don't use BlocProvider.value() when navigating

### Issue: Background Flutter processes
**Solution:** Kill all processes:
```bash
killall -9 flutter dart chrome
```

## Important Notes

- **Mock Services:** Currently using mock services (`useMockServices: true` in main.dart)
- **Data Persistence:** Mock data is in-memory only, resets on refresh
- **Firebase:** Configured but not actively used for data operations yet
- **Testing:** Guest login is fastest way to test features
