# Development Session 2025-10-01

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Phase 10: King of the Mountain Avatar System - Initial Implementation

**Branch:** `feature/avatar-system`

**Commits:**
- `13f731b` - Initial avatar system implementation
- `ea66e3f` - Solo play enabled and avatar improvements
- `a94e042` - Documentation of known issues

### Features Implemented

1. **Avatar Game Engine**
   - Flame game engine (v1.32.0) integration
   - Forge2D physics (v0.19.2) for realistic movement
   - KingOfMountainGame class with gravity and collisions

2. **Player Avatars**
   - Circular heads with player initials
   - Color-coded bodies based on player ID
   - Name labels with shadows
   - Crown for "king" (avatar at top)

3. **NPC Avatars**
   - Animal emoji faces: 🐶🐱🐭🐹🐰🦊🐻🐼
   - Auto-spawn when < 10 players
   - Slightly randomized behavior

4. **Autonomous AI**
   - Pathfinding to climb platforms
   - Jump logic when aligned below targets
   - Wander behavior when stuck

5. **Game Mechanics**
   - 5 platforms at different heights
   - Peak platform (gold) at top
   - Physics-based pushing between avatars
   - Toggle visibility button

6. **Integration**
   - AvatarGameOverlay widget
   - Shows only in lobby status (before game starts)
   - Positioned on right side (desktop) or full-width (mobile)

7. **Solo Play Support**
   - Removed 2-player requirement
   - Players can now test games alone
   - Play as both player and judge

## Known Issues to Fix Next Session

### 1. Black Rectangle Rendering
**Severity:** High
**Description:** Large black rectangle visible on right side, requires zooming to 25% to see avatars
**Possible Causes:**
- Canvas rendering conflict
- Boundary walls still rendering despite `isVisible: false`
- Scaling issues with Flame/Flutter overlay

**Next Steps:**
- Debug canvas rendering pipeline
- Check IgnorePointer configuration
- May need to override render() more aggressively
- Consider using ClipRect to hide overflow

### 2. Avatar Design Not Intuitive
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** Generic platforms don't relate to actual game tasks
**Proposed Solution:**
- Redesign so each task becomes a platform
- Avatars climb as tasks are completed
- Visual representation of game progress
- More meaningful and engaging

**Implementation Plan:**
- Create TaskPlatformComponent instead of generic platforms
- Position based on task list from game
- Update platform height as tasks complete
- Add task titles/icons to platforms

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** Not tested on actual mobile devices
**Next Steps:**
- Deploy to Firebase for mobile testing
- Test on various screen sizes
- Verify touch controls work
- Check performance on low-end devices

### 4. Canvas Rendering Optimization
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** May be performance issues with overlay
**Next Steps:**
- Profile rendering performance
- Consider reducing physics update rate
- Add device capability detection
- Implement fallback to static view

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `lib/features/avatars/game/king_of_mountain_game.dart`
- `lib/features/avatars/game/components/player_avatar.dart`
- `lib/features/avatars/game/components/npc_avatar.dart`
- `lib/features/avatars/game/components/platform_component.dart`
- `lib/features/avatars/presentation/widgets/avatar_game_overlay.dart`
- `lib/features/avatars/README.md`
- `test/features/avatars/king_of_mountain_test.dart`

### Modified Files
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added Flame dependencies
- `lib/features/games/presentation/widgets/game_lobby_view.dart` - Integrated overlay
- `lib/features/games/data/repositories/game_repository_impl.dart` - Solo play
- `lib/features/games/data/datasources/firestore_game_data_source.dart` - Solo play
- `DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Phase 10 documentation

## Testing Status

### ✅ Completed
- Basic compilation (with newer Flame API fixes)
- Solo play functionality
- Avatar visibility toggle
- NPC spawning logic

### ⏳ Pending
- Black rectangle issue resolution
- Mobile device testing
- Performance optimization
- Task-based platform redesign

## Dependencies Added

```yaml
flame: ^1.21.0          # Upgraded for compatibility
flame_forge2d: ^0.19.0  # Upgraded for compatibility
```

## Next Session Tasks

1. **Fix black rectangle issue** (Priority: High)
   - Debug rendering pipeline
   - Test different scaling approaches
   - Verify on multiple browsers

2. **Redesign as task platforms** (Priority: High)
   - More meaningful visual representation
   - Better game integration
   - User feedback indicated this would be preferred

3. **Deploy to Firebase** (Priority: Medium)
   - Test on actual mobile devices
   - Bypass Zscaler local development issues
   - Get real-world performance data

4. **Performance optimization** (Priority: Low)
   - Profile frame rates
   - Optimize physics calculations
   - Add device capability detection

## Notes

- Zscaler is blocking local Flutter debug mode (WebSocket connections)
- `flutter build web` + Python HTTP server works for local testing
- Puppeteer blank screen is expected (headless Chrome issue, not app issue)
- User's regular Chrome shows app working correctly

## Branch Status

**Current Branch:** `feature/avatar-system`
**Status:** Ready for continued development
**Merge to main:** Not yet - waiting for black rectangle fix

**To continue next session:**
```bash
git checkout feature/avatar-system
flutter build web
cd build/web && python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
